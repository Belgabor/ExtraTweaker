ExtraTweaker
============

A Minecraft mod to add some additional capabilities to [CraftTweaker](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/crafttweaker-customized-minetweaker3) 
(CraftTweaker is based on [MineTweaker](http://minetweaker3.powerofbytes.com/) and the current implementation on Minecraft 1.9.4) and some useful 
vanilla commands.

ExtraTweaker is the successor to [AMTweaker](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/amtweaker), which will not be ported as is to 1.9.4 
(The name was based on [Apple, Milk & Tea 2](http://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/229325-applemilktea2), which will not be updated to 1.9.x+).

I will add support for mods I like and don't have Mine-/Crafttweaker support by themselves or other addons, currently this is only
a port of the vanilla features I added in version 1.0 of AMTweaker.

Features:
* Command to dump block statistics in a certain radius around the player to a ;-separated csv file. Intended to evaluate worldgen (duplicate ores, generation level & amount)
* [v0.2] Command to dump mod load order
* [MT] change harvest level and tool for blocks and tools themselves (no guarantee it works for modded stuff)
* [MT] change tool durability (no guarantee it works for modded stuff)
* [MT, v0.3] change block hardness, blast resistance, emitted light level and light opacity (no guarantee it works for every block)
